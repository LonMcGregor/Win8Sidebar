Win8Sidebar
===========

A windows 8 styled sidebar for a webpage. Has links for sharing, site settigngs, searching etc. Could be used as a minimal replacement for a large sidebar on a tumblog (for example).

Here is an example gif of the code at work. http://31.media.tumblr.com/2cd55696a0022d87264883b8e0928c9a/tumblr_n3v56sFoLY1rvaalyo1_500.gif

Note that it is currently broken slightly, but you are welcome to try it out. Just use the code in Stable/thing.js in a <script> tag.
